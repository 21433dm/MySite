	<p>An Act of Parliament provided for the raising of the 62nd (Royal American Regiment) Foot on Christmas Day 1755. Due to renumbering of the British Army, the 62nd became altered to the 60th (Royal American Regiment) Foot in 1757. Though its title was changed, first to The Duke of Yorks Own Rifle Corps and finally, in 1830, to The Kings Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC), throughout its life the Regiment was known familiarly as the 60th Rifles. The Regiment recruited from colonists and volunteers from other British Regiments with the purpose of adopting an "Indian system" of forest warfare with lighter equipment, more mobile and open formations. This was because the European method of mass volleys launched in unison proved to be ineffectual when fighting in the dense woodland of North America. The Regiment formation was in direct response to "Braddock's Defeat" in 1755 when a British military expedition failed to capture the French Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War.</p>

	<p>The Regiment introduced new tactics, new weapons, and new uniforms. Many characteristics connected with these innovations took root in the 60th Rifles and are to this day cherished by the successors of the Regiment. Their green dress uniforms with trousers so cut as to force a quick-step, the way they stand at ease, the fact that they have no flags, or colours, the use of the word "Rifleman" rather than "Private" for the men in the ranks, above all their sharpshooting, distinguish the officers and men of the Kings Royal Rifle Corps from the rest of the British Army.</p>

	<p>The 1st battalion was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Henri Bouquet and his ingenuity led to the Regiment being more lightly equipped and camouflaged and focused upon certain attributes such as independent action and swift initiative enforced with firm discipline. The Royal American Regiment played a distinguished part in establishing British power in North America. The leadership of the distinguished officers generated a succession of advanced ideas later to be adopted as ideals by the rest of the Army: open-order tactics and mobility in place of rigid drills and ponderous movement, camouflage and concealment in place of serried ranks and red coats, individual marksmanship in place of musket fire, and intelligence and self-reliance in place of blind obedience instilled by the fear of brutal punishment.</p>

	<p>From the victory at Louisbourg in 1758 to the wars and armed conflicts in the world until the Regiment ceased to be independent in 1965, the 60th Rifles remained the same in fighting quality. The Regiment became an invaluable part of any campaign therefore were present at most action of the British Empire including; The Conquest Of Canada 1785, The Peninsula War (1808-1814), The Indian Mutiny (1857-1859), The Zulu War 1879, The American Civil War (1861-1865), Afghanistan, Manipur and Burma (1878-1898) and South Africa (1899-1902). Following the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 the Regiment was awarded the new title of The Duke of York's Own Rifle Corps when His Royal Highness Frederick, Duke of York became colonel (and later Commander-in-Chief) until his death in 1827. This was changed to the King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC) in 1830 when King George IV ascended to the throne and his brother His Royal Highness Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge became colonel. </p> 

	<p>The Regiment was given the motto "Celer et Audax" (Swift and Bold) by General Wolfe at Quebec in 1759. The Royal Green Jackets adopted 'Swift and Bold' as its motto on its formation in 1966. In February 2007, the Motto was inherited by the newly formed The Rifles.</p>
	
	<p>In 1948 the Regiment was merged with The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) to form The Green Jackets Brigade, further amalgamations followed with the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry in 1958. In 1966 these three Regiments became the three battalions of the Royal Green Jackets and in 2007 were further merged with the Devonshire and Dorset Light Infantry, The Light Infantry and The Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Light Infantry to become The Rifles.<p>
