		<h2>The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)</h2>

	</header>
	<p>The Regiment was first raised on the 17th January 1800 as an elite and "Experimental Corps of Riflemen", by Colonel Coote Manningham and Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. William Stewart. It drew recruits from a variety of British Regiments to train them as ‘sharpshooters, scouts and skirmishers’ and were armed with the Baker rifle, which was more accurate and had a longer range than the musket, but took longer to load.</p>

	<p>The idea of individual soldiers hitting specific targets seems wholly unorthodox at the time, with the conventional tactic of the mass volley being favoured. The Regiment was trained to use natural cover (wearing green instead of the traditional red, in order to camouflage the soldiers), worked in pairs in the open and trained to think for themselves in order to harass the enemy. On the 25th August 1800 three companies were taken on an expedition against the north coast of Spain. The Rifle Corps managed to occupy and hold a ridge of hills against a large enemy party. The success of this expedition has meant a Rifle Corps has existed ever since. In January 1803 the Regiment was renamed The 95th Rifles.</p> 

	<p>The Regiment became an invaluable part of any campaign therefore were present at most actions of the British Empire including; The Battle of Waterloo 1815, The Crimean War (1854-1856), The Indian Mutiny (1857-1859), The American Civil War (1861-1865), Afghanistan, Burma, Ashantee, Khartoum (1878-1898) and South Africa (1899-1902).</p>

	<p>In 1816 following their distinguished service in the Napoleonic Wars The 95th Rifles became The Rifle Brigade and then in 1823 they were renamed The 95th (Derbyshire) Regiment of Foot. The Regiment was highly trained, educated and well disciplined thus enjoyed immense social prestige at this time. So much so that in 1861 on the death of its Colonel-in-Chief, Prince Albert, The Queen bestowed the title of "The Prince Consort's Own Rifle Brigade" on the Regiment.</p>

	<p>In 1948 the Regiment was merged with the King's Royal Rifle Corps to form The Green Jackets Brigade further amalgamations followed with the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry in 1958. In 1966 these three Regiments became the three battalions of the Royal Green Jackets and in 2007 were further merged with the Devonshire and Dorset Light Infantry, The Light Infantry and The Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Light Infantry to become The Rifles.</p>

	<p>The history of The Rifle Brigade is second to none, making it extremely difficult to cover every aspect of it. What is clear is how involved the 95th/RB were in fighting in engagements and keeping the peace during the time of its 165 years of service to the crown. When looking at the Battle Honours these clearly show the involvement of the Regiment world-wide, what they do not do is illustrate the many Campaigns it has also been involved in. These are covered in the Time Lines or in Campaign stories such as Borneo.</p>
